## [1.0.7]
### 🎵 Audirvana Compatibility Fix

**Problem:**
- Audirvana pre-decodes audio and wraps it in a strange format
- Standard DSD native mode failed with Audirvana
- DSD playback resulted in incorrect format or no audio

**Solution:**
- Detect Audirvana streams via URL pattern (`/audirvana/`)
- For Audirvana DSD: Use FFmpeg decoding instead of raw mode
- For other sources: Continue using DSD native mode

**Result:**
- ✅ Audirvana DSD (DoP) works as follow→ Decoded to PCM Hi-Res (352.8k/705.6k DirettaHostSDK doesn't support DoP)
- ✅ BubbleUPnP/JPLAY DSD works → Native DSD bitstream to DAC
- ✅ No regression on PCM formats

### 🔧 Float Buffer Support (Sub-second Precision)

**Problem:**
- Buffer stored as `int`, causing truncation for values < 1 second
- Example: 0.8s buffer → cast to int → 0 seconds!
- Result: Buffer underruns, audio artifacts (pink noise)

**Tested:**
- ✅ DSD with 0.8s buffer works correctly
- ✅ PCM with 1.2s buffer works correctly
- ✅ No regression on integer buffer values

**Files Modified:**
- `DirettaOutput.h` - Changed member type
- `DirettaOutput.cpp` - Updated calculations
- `DirettaRenderer.h` - Updated config
- `main.cpp` - Updated default value

**Feature:**
- Intelligent buffer sizing based on audio format complexity
- Sub-second precision using float instead of int

**Buffer Strategy:**

| Format Type | Buffer Size | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| DSD (DSF/DFF) | 0.8s | Raw bitstream, instant read |
| PCM Standard (≤48kHz/16-bit) | 1.0s | Low data rate, minimal latency |
| PCM Hi-Res (≥88.2kHz/24-bit) | 1.2-1.5s | High data rate, DAC stabilization |
| Compressed (FLAC/ALAC) | 2.0s | Decode overhead required |

**Benefits:**
- No more 10-second or more startup delays but a delay betwwen 3 to 8 seconds still occurs
- Optimal latency for each format type
- Maintains stability for Hi-Res and compressed formats

**Files Modified:**
- `DirettaOutput.h` - Changed buffer type to float
- `DirettaOutput.cpp` - Adaptive buffer logic
- `DirettaRenderer.h` - Updated config structure
- `main.cpp` - Default buffer reduced from 10s to 2s

### 🔴 CRITICAL FIX: Stop/Play Cycle (Audirvana Exclusive Mode)

**Problem:**
- After STOP command (especially with Audirvana exclusive mode unlock), DirettaOutput is closed
- Next PLAY command incorrectly attempted to resume from a closed connection
- `isPaused()` flag remained true even after connection was closed
- Result: Crash, freeze, or undefined behavior requiring double PLAY

**Tested:**
- ✅ PAUSE → PLAY works correctly (true resume)
- ✅ STOP → PLAY works on first attempt
- ✅ Multiple STOP/PLAY cycles are stable
- ✅ Audirvana exclusive mode fully functional

**Files Modified:**
- `DirettaRenderer.cpp` - onPlay callback logic

### Fixed
- **Dynamic sample rate switching**: Fixed DAC not changing sample rate when transitioning between tracks with different formats (e.g., 96kHz → 44.1kHz)
  - Root cause: After `close()`, the callback would immediately `open()` with the new format without giving the Diretta Target time to reinitialize
  - Solution: Added persistent format tracking using static variables to detect format changes even after `close()`, and implemented a 500ms pause before reopening to allow the Target's clock generator and PLL to properly reset
  - The Diretta Target now correctly reconfigures the DAC for each format change
  - Format changes are properly logged with detailed transition information

### Changed
- **Improved audio thread logging**: Reduced log spam when `process()` returns false
  - Now logs only every 100 consecutive failures instead of every occurrence
  - Prevents multi-gigabyte log files during idle states
  - Added consecutive failure counter for better debugging visibility

### Technical Details
- Format change detection now works in two scenarios:
  1. When `isConnected() == true`: Compares current format with `getFormat()`
  2. When `isConnected() == false`: Compares with last known format stored in static variable (critical for JPLAY's AUTO-STOP behavior)
- Total format change duration: ~1 second (500ms Target reset + 290ms SyncBuffer setup + 200ms DAC stabilization)
- Validated transitions: PCM ↔ PCM (different sample rates), PCM ↔ DSD

### Notes
- Format changes between tracks are expected to have a brief pause (~1s) for proper DAC reconfiguration
- Gapless playback for tracks with the same format remains unaffected and works seamlessly
- This fix enables proper bit-perfect playback across entire multi-format playlists

## [1.0.6]
### Add
**Verbose Logging Mode**
- Added optional --verbose mode to reduce console output verbosity
By default, the renderer now displays only essential user-facing messages. Technical debug information can be enabled using the --verbose flag.
- Example:
sudo ./DirettaRendererUPnP --port 4005 --target 1 --buffer 0.9 --verbose
Command Line Options

- Added --verbose / -v flag to enable detailed debug output
- Added --help documentation for the new verbose mode

**Version Display**
- Added version display type:
   
  ./DirettaRenderer --version or ./DirettaRendererUPnP -V
  
### Fixed
- Removed clicks or pink noise bursts at the end of the album or during the transition between tracks in a playlist
 * Buffers weren't correctly cleared at the en of an album or during a format change.
- Disable gapless playback on format changes (Many thanks to herisson88)
  * When the next track has a different format (sample rate, bit depth,
channels, or DSD vs PCM), disable gapless transition and force a
clean stop/start sequence to prevent audio artifacts.
- Optimize FFmpeg settings for faster streaming startup (Many thanks to herisson88)
  * Add probesize (1MB) and analyzeduration (1.5s) for faster initial buffering
  * Increase network buffer from 32KB to 512KB for better stability
    
Fix thread-safety issues in AudioEngine (Many thanks to herisson88)

- Replace unsafe detached preload thread with joinable thread
  * Add m_preloadThread member and m_preloadRunning atomic flag
  * Add waitForPreloadThread() helper called in stop() and destructor
  * Prevents use-after-free when AudioEngine is destroyed during preload
- Fix race condition in setNextURI()
  * std::string is not thread-safe for concurrent read/write
  * Add pending mechanism with m_pendingMutex protection
  * UPnP thread queues URI, audio thread applies it safely in process()
  * Use memory_order_acquire/release for proper synchronization
- Update stop() to clear pending state and wait for preload thread
- Update process() to apply pending next URI before processing
Serialize UPnP action callbacks to prevent race conditions
- When multiple UPnP commands arrive in quick succession (e.g., rapid track
skipping), they can execute concurrently and cause race conditions leading
to silent playback or segmentation faults.
- Add std::lock_guard<std::mutex> at the entry of each UPnP
callback to ensure only one action executes at a time:
 * onSetURI
 * onSetNextURI
 * onPlay
 * onPause
 * onStop
 * onSeek

## [1.0.5]
### Fixed
**Audio Player**
  - No more delays when starting playback
  Now you can set --buffer from 0.5 to 4.0 to ensure gapless playback on your setup.
  Buffer from 0.5 to 1.0 no delay.
  Buffer from 1.0 to 4.0 increase delay but can guarantee stability and gapless on some equipment.


## [1.0.4]
 ### Fixed
  **Audio**
  - Correct PCM data size calculation and convert S32 to S24 format
  - Improving the detection of actual bit depth from the audio source
  - Fixed detection of actual bit depth from audio source
  - Detect real bit depth from source instead of relying on FFmpeg's internal format
  - Adjust sync buffer thread mode to improve performance (thanks to herisson88)
 **Diretta Target**
  - Increase retry delay for target availability verification from 2 to 5 seconds
  - Update target information display to use targetName instead of Device
  - Correct iteration over targets and target selection by index
 **Systemd**
  - Update service management instructions in installation script
  - Improve binary detection and installation instructions in the systemd script
 ### Add
  **Diretta Target**
  - Implement retry mechanism for target discovery with detailed feedback
  **Systemd**
  - Update service management instructions in installation script
  - Add a uninstall script for diretta-renderer.service
  - Add systemd service and configuration for Diretta UPnP Renderer
