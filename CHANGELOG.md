# Changelog - Version 1.1.1

## [1.1.1] - 2024-12-25

### Fixed

#### **CRITICAL: Deadlock causing no audio output on slower systems (RPi4, etc.)**
- **Issue**: Renderer would freeze after "Waiting for DAC stabilization" message, no audio output
- **Affected systems**: Primarily Raspberry Pi 4 and other ARM-based systems, occasional issues on slower x86 systems
- **Root cause**: Mutex (`m_mutex`) held during `waitForCallbackComplete()` in `onSetURI` callback
  - Added in v1.0.8 for JPlay iOS compatibility (Auto-STOP feature)
  - On slow CPUs (RPi4), the audio callback thread would attempt to acquire the same mutex
  - Result: Deadlock - each thread waiting for the other
- **Solution**: Release `m_mutex` before calling `waitForCallbackComplete()`
  - Lock mutex → Read state → Unlock
  - Perform Auto-STOP without mutex held
  - Re-lock mutex → Update URI → Unlock
- **Impact**: Fixes freeze on all systems, maintains JPlay iOS compatibility
- **Technical details**:
  ```cpp
  // BEFORE (v1.1.0 - DEADLOCK):
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_mutex);  // Held entire time
  auto currentState = m_audioEngine->getState();
  // ... Auto-STOP ...
  waitForCallbackComplete();  // DEADLOCK: waiting while mutex locked
  
  // AFTER (v1.1.1 - FIXED):
  {
      std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_mutex);
      currentState = m_audioEngine->getState();
  }  // Mutex released here
  // ... Auto-STOP ...
  waitForCallbackComplete();  // SAFE: no mutex held
  ```

#### **Multi-interface support not working**
- **Issue**: `--interface` option parsed but ignored, UPnP always bound to default interface
- **Symptom**: 
  ```
  ✓ Will bind to interface: enp1s0u1u1  ← Recognized
  🌐 Using default interface for UPnP (auto-detect)  ← Ignored!
  ✓ UPnP initialized on 172.20.0.1:4005  ← Wrong interface
  ```
- **Root cause**: `networkInterface` parameter not passed from `DirettaRenderer::Config` to `UPnPDevice::Config`
- **Solution**: Added missing parameter propagation in `DirettaRenderer.cpp`:
  ```cpp
  upnpConfig.networkInterface = m_config.networkInterface;
  ```
- **Impact**: Multi-interface support now works correctly for 3-tier architectures

#### **Raspberry Pi variant detection (Makefile)**
- **Issue**: RPi3/4 incorrectly detected as k16 variant (16KB pages), causing link errors
- **Symptom**:
  ```
  Architecture:  ARM64 (aarch64) - Kernel 6.12 (using k16 variant)  ← WRONG for RPi4
  Variant:       aarch64-linux-15k16  ← RPi4 doesn't support k16
  ```
- **Root cause**: Detection based on kernel version (>= 4.16) instead of actual page size
  - RPi3/4: 4KB pages, need `aarch64-linux-15`
  - RPi5: 16KB pages, need `aarch64-linux-15k16`
  - Kernel 6.12 on RPi4 triggered wrong detection
- **Solution**: Use `getconf PAGESIZE` and `/proc/device-tree/model` for accurate detection
  ```makefile
  PAGE_SIZE := $(shell getconf PAGESIZE)
  IS_RPI5 := $(shell grep -q "Raspberry Pi 5" /proc/device-tree/model)
  
  # Use k16 only if explicitly RPi5 or 16KB pages detected
  ```
- **Impact**: Correct library selection on all Raspberry Pi models

### Changed
- Improved mutex handling in UPnP callbacks for better thread safety
- Enhanced Makefile architecture detection logic for ARM systems

### Technical Notes

#### Deadlock Debug Information
The deadlock manifested differently based on system performance:
- **Fast x86 systems**: Rare or no issues (callback completes before conflict)
- **Slow ARM systems (RPi4)**: Consistent freeze (timing window for deadlock much larger)
- **Trigger**: User changing tracks/albums while audio playing
- **Timing window**: 400ms sleep in callback provided ample opportunity for deadlock on slow systems

#### Multi-Interface Fix
Affects users with:
- 3-tier architecture (control points on one network, DAC on another)
- VPN + local network configurations
- Multiple Ethernet adapters
- Any scenario requiring explicit interface binding

Without this fix, the `--interface` parameter was completely ignored, making 3-tier setups impossible.

#### Raspberry Pi Detection
Previous kernel-based detection failed because:
- Kernel version indicates OS capability, not hardware configuration
- RPi4 can run kernel 6.12+ but hardware still uses 4KB pages
- RPi5 introduced 16KB pages and requires different SDK library variant
- Using wrong variant causes immediate segfault on startup

### Compatibility

## Summary of Critical Fixes in v1.1.1

| Issue | Severity | Affected Systems | Status |
|-------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Deadlock (no audio) | **CRITICAL** | RPi4, slower systems | ✅ **FIXED** |
| Multi-interface ignored | **HIGH** | 3-tier setups | ✅ **FIXED** |
| Wrong RPi variant | **CRITICAL** | RPi3/4 | ✅ **FIXED** |

**All critical issues resolved. v1.1.1 is recommended for all users, especially those on Raspberry Pi systems.**


## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- 🌐 **Multi-interface support** for multi-homed systems
  - New command-line option: `--interface <name>` to bind to specific network interface (e.g., eth0, eno1, enp6s0)
  - New command-line option: `--bind-ip <address>` to bind to specific IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10)
  - Essential for 3-tier architecture configurations with separate control and audio networks
  - Fixes SSDP discovery issues on systems with multiple network interfaces (VPN, multiple NICs, bridged networks)
  - Auto-detection remains default behavior for single-interface systems (backward compatible)
  
- **Advanced Configuration with command-line Parameters**
  - ### Basic Options

```bash
--name, -n <name>       Renderer name (default: Diretta Renderer)
--port, -p <port>       UPnP port (default: auto)
--buffer, -b <seconds>  Buffer size in seconds (default: 2.0)
--target, -t <index>    Select Diretta target by index (1, 2, 3...)
--no-gapless            Disable gapless playback
--verbose               Enable verbose debug output
```
 - ### Advanced Diretta SDK Options
Fine-tune the Diretta protocol behavior for optimal performance such as Thread-mode, transfer timing....

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed format change freeze when transitioning between bit depths
  - **Issue**: Playlist playback would freeze for 10 seconds when switching between 24-bit and 16-bit tracks
  - **Root cause**: 4 residual samples in Diretta SDK buffer never drained, causing timeout
  - **Solution**: Implemented force flush with silence padding to push incomplete frames through pipeline
  - **Result**: Format changes now complete in ~200-300ms instead of 10-second timeout
  - **Impact**: Smooth playlist playback with mixed formats (16-bit/24-bit/32-bit)
- Improved error recovery during format transitions
- Better handling of incomplete audio frames at track boundaries

### Changed
- **UPnP Initialization**: Now uses `UpnpInit2()` with interface parameter for precise network binding
- **Format Change Timeout**: Reduced from 10s to 3s for faster error recovery
- **Buffer Drain Logic**: Added tolerance for ≤4 residual samples (considered "empty enough")
- **Hardware Stabilization**: Increased from 200ms to 300ms for better reliability during format changes
- **Logging**: Enhanced debug output during format change sequence with flush detection

### Configuration
- **Systemd**: New `NETWORK_INTERFACE` parameter in `/opt/diretta-renderer-upnp/diretta-renderer.conf`
  ```bash
  # For 3-tier architecture
  NETWORK_INTERFACE="eth0"      # Interface connected to control points
  
  # Or by IP address
  NETWORK_INTERFACE="192.168.1.10"
  ```
- **Wrapper Script**: Automatically detects whether parameter is IP address or interface name

### Use Cases

#### Multi-Interface Scenarios
1. **3-tier Architecture** (recommended by dsnyder):
   - Control Points (JPlay, Roon) on 192.168.1.x via eth0
   - Diretta DAC on 192.168.2.x via eth1
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/DirettaRendererUPnP --interface eth0 --target 1
   ```

2. **VPN + Local Network**:
   - Local network on 192.168.1.x via eth0
   - VPN on 10.0.0.x via tun0
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/DirettaRendererUPnP --bind-ip 192.168.1.10 --target 1
   ```

3. **Multiple Ethernet Adapters**:
   - Specify which adapter handles UPnP discovery
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/DirettaRendererUPnP --interface eno1 --target 1
   ```

#### Format Change Improvements
- **Mixed Format Playlists**: Seamless transitions between 16-bit, 24-bit, and different sample rates
- **Streaming Services**: Better compatibility with services like Qobuz that mix bit depths
- **Gapless Playback**: Maintains gapless behavior even during format changes

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive **Multi-Homed Systems** section in README
- Added troubleshooting guide for network interface selection
- Added examples for common multi-interface configurations
- Updated systemd configuration guide
- Added FORMAT_CHANGE_FIX.md technical documentation

### Technical Details

#### Multi-Interface Implementation
- Modified `UPnPDevice.cpp`: `UpnpInit2(interfaceName, port)` instead of `UpnpInit2(nullptr, port)`
- Added `networkInterface` parameter to `UPnPDevice::Config` structure
- Propagated interface selection from command-line → DirettaRenderer → UPnPDevice
- Enhanced error messages when binding fails (suggests `ip link show`, permissions check)

#### Format Change Fix Implementation
- Added **Step 1.5** in `changeFormat()`: Force flush with 128 samples of silence padding
  - Pushes incomplete frames through Diretta SDK pipeline
  - Only triggered when residual < 64 samples detected
- Modified drain logic to accept small residual (≤4 samples) as successful
- Implemented `sendAudio()` function for unified audio data transmission
- Better synchronization between AudioEngine and DirettaOutput during transitions

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible

### Migration Guide
