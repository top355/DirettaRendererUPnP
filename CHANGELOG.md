# Changelog

All notable changes to the Diretta UPnP Renderer project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Web UI for configuration
- Volume control via UPnP RenderingControl
- Configuration file support
- Docker container
- Systemd service generator script


---
## [1.0.5]
### Fixed
**Audio Player**
  - No more delays when starting playback
  Now you can set --buffer from 0.5 to 4.0 to ensure gapless playback on your setup.
  Buffer from 0.5 to 1.0 no delay.
  Buffer from 1.0 to 4.0 increase delay but can guarantee stability and gapless on some equipment.


## [1.0.4]
 ### Fixed
  **Audio**
  - Correct PCM data size calculation and convert S32 to S24 format
  - Improving the detection of actual bit depth from the audio source
  - Fixed detection of actual bit depth from audio source
  - Detect real bit depth from source instead of relying on FFmpeg's internal format
  - Adjust sync buffer thread mode to improve performance (thanks to herisson88)
 **Diretta Target**
  - Increase retry delay for target availability verification from 2 to 5 seconds
  - Update target information display to use targetName instead of Device
  - Correct iteration over targets and target selection by index
 **Systemd**
  - Update service management instructions in installation script
  - Improve binary detection and installation instructions in the systemd script
 ### Add
  **Diretta Target**
  - Implement retry mechanism for target discovery with detailed feedback
  **Systemd**
  - Update service management instructions in installation script
  - Add a uninstall script for diretta-renderer.service
  - Add systemd service and configuration for Diretta UPnP Renderer

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-07
 ### Added
  **Display more device-friendly information when outputting device list**
  - Added display of target device name
  - Display device output name and configuration information
  - Output product ID in hexadecimal format
  - Display protocol version number
  - Indicate whether multi-port support is enabled
  - Display synchronization status and its detailed parameters




## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-06

### Added
  **restructuring of the Makefile to:**
  - automatically manage library variants depending on the CPU architecture,
  - ensure multi‑platform compatibility (x64, ARM64),
  - prevent errors on unsupported architectures,
  - simplify maintenance by centralizing the suffix into a reusable variable for all libraries
  **Diretta target device selection and validation features**
  - Implemented the findAndSelectTarget function to support automatic or interactive target selection.
  - Added the verifyTargetAvailable function to check whether valid targets exist on the network.
  - Implemented the listAvailableTargets function to list all detected Diretta targets.
  - Added a new m_targetIndex member and related setter functions to the DirettaOutput class.
  - Ensured that DirettaRenderer verifies target availability before startup, preventing launch without a valid device.
  - Extended main.cpp with new command‑line arguments:
          --target to set the target index
          --list-targets to display available targets
  - Enhanced the command‑line help messages, adding usage instructions for target selection.
  - Adjusted the default buffer size warning messages to improve user experience.
  **Documentation (Installation): Diretta Target Listing & Selection**
  - Added “List Diretta Targets” and “Select Diretta Target” sections to README.md, guiding users on how to scan the network for  Diretta devices
  - Expanded INSTALLATION.md with detailed instructions on listing and selecting targets via command line
  - Introduced generate_service.sh script to automatically create systemd service files, enabling configuration of target index and parameters
  - Updated system service configuration examples to support customization of target index, port, and buffer size via environment variables
  - Documented behavior where, if no target is explicitly specified and only one device is detected, the renderer will automatically use that target

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed
- **Gapless playback bug**: Fixed issue where tracks from previous album would play after Stop
  - Clear next URI queue on Stop action
  - Clear next URI queue when setting new transport URI
- **UPnP gapless detection**: Added SetNextAVTransportURI action declaration in SCPD
  - BubbleUPnP and other control points now properly detect gapless support

### Added
- Multi-architecture support in Makefile (x64: v2/v3/v4/zen4, ARM64, RISC-V)
- Automatic CPU capability detection for optimal library selection
- `make list-variants` command to show available library variants
- `make arch-info` command for architecture detection details

### Changed
- Makefile now auto-detects architecture and uses appropriate Diretta library (.a)
- Improved SCPD completeness (added Seek, GetMediaInfo, Next, Previous actions)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-03

### Added
