# Changelog

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-
### 🚀 NEW FEATURES
 **Same-Format Fast Path (Thanks to SwissMountainsBear)**
 Track transitions within the same audio format are now dramatically faster.

BEFORE: 600-1200ms (full reconnection, configuration, DAC lock)
AFTER:  <50ms (instant resume)

Performance Gain: 24× faster transitions

How it works:
- Connection kept alive between same-format tracks
- Smart buffer management (DSD: silence clearing, PCM: seek_front)
- Format changes still trigger full reconnection (safe behavior)

Impact:
- Seamless album playback (DSD64, DSD128, DSD256, DSD512)
- Better user experience with control points (JPLAY, Bubble UPnP, etc.)
- Especially beneficial for high DSD rates where reconnection is expensive

Technical details:
- Implemented in DirettaOutput::open() with format comparison
- Format change detection enhanced for reliability
- Connection persistence logic in DirettaRenderer callbacks


📡 Dynamic Cycle Time Calculation

**Network timing now adapts automatically to audio format characteristics**

 Implementation:
- New DirettaCycleCalculator class analyzes format parameters
- Calculates optimal cycle time based on sample rate, bit depth, channels
- Considers MTU size and network overhead (24 bytes)
- Range: 100µs to 50ms (dynamically calculated per format)

Results:
- DSD64 (2.8MHz):  ~23ms optimal cycle time (was 10ms fixed)
- PCM 44.1k:       ~50ms optimal cycle time (was 10ms fixed)
- DSD512:          ~5ms optimal cycle time (high throughput)

Performance Impact:
- PCM 44.1k: Network packets reduced from 100/sec to 20/sec (5× reduction)
- Better MTU utilization: PCM now uses 55% of 16K jumbo frames vs 11% before
- Significantly reduced audio dropouts
- Lower CPU overhead for network operations

Technical details:
- Formula: cycleTime = (effectiveMTU / bytesPerSecond) × 1,000,000 µs
- Effective MTU = configured MTU - 24 bytes overhead
- Applied in DirettaOutput::optimizeNetworkConfig()

### 🐛 CRITICAL BUGFIXES (Thanks to SwissMountainsBear)
 🔴 Shadow Variable in Audio Thread (DirettaRenderer.cpp)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: 
- Two separate `static int failCount` variables in if/else branches
- Reset logic never worked (wrong variable scope)
- Consecutive failure counter didn't accumulate properly

Impact:
- Inaccurate error reporting
- Misleading debug logs

Fix:
- Moved static declaration outside if/else scope
- Single shared variable for both success and failure paths
- Proper counter reset on success

Files: src/DirettaRenderer.cpp


🟡 Duplicate DEBUG_LOG (AudioEngine.cpp)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Problem:
- PCM format logged twice in verbose mode
- First log statement missing semicolon (potential compilation issue)

Impact:
- Cluttered logs in verbose mode
- Risk of compilation errors on strict compilers

Fix:
- Removed duplicate log statement
- Ensured proper semicolon on remaining log

Files: src/AudioEngine.cpp


🔴 AudioBuffer Rule of Three Violation (AudioEngine.h)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Problem:
- AudioBuffer class manages raw memory (new[]/delete[])
- No copy constructor or copy assignment operator
- Risk of double-delete crash if buffer accidentally copied

Impact:
- Potential crashes (double-delete)
- Undefined behavior with buffer copies
- Memory safety issue

Fix:
- Added copy prevention: Copy constructor/assignment = delete
- Implemented move semantics for safe ownership transfer
- Move constructor and move assignment operator added

### ⚠️  BEHAVIOR CHANGES
 **DSD Seek Disabled**
 Issue: 
DSD seek causes audio distortion and desynchronization due to buffer 
alignment issues and SDK synchronization problems.

Implementation:
- DSD seek commands are accepted (return success) but not executed
- Prevents crashes in poorly-implemented UPnP clients (e.g., JPLAY iOS)
- Audio continues playing without interruption
- Position tracking may be approximate

Behavior:
- PCM: Seek works perfectly with exact positioning
- DSD: Seek command ignored (no-op), playback continues

Workaround:
For precise DSD positioning: Use Stop → Seek → Play sequence

Technical details:
- Blocked in AudioEngine::process() before calling AudioDecoder::seek()
- DirettaOutput::seek() commented out (unused code)
- Resume without seek for DSD (position approximate)

## 🔄 MIGRATION FROM v1.2.x
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

No configuration changes required. All improvements are automatic.

Optional Recommendations:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For DSD256/512 users: Consider increasing buffer parameter if minor scratches 
occur during fast path transitions:

  --buffer 1.0   (for DSD256)
  --buffer 1.2   (for DSD512)

This provides more headroom for same-format transitions.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-06

### 🎵 DSD Format Enhancement Thanks to [SwissMountainBear ](https://github.com/[SwissMontainsBear](https://github.com/SwissMontainsBear))

**Improved DSD File Detection**
- **Smart DSF vs DFF detection**: Automatic detection of DSD source format based on file extension (`.dsf` or `.dff`)
- **Bit order handling**: Proper bit reversal flag (`m_needDsdBitReversal`) to handle LSB-first (DSF) vs MSB-first (DFF) formats
- **Format propagation**: DSD source format information flows from AudioEngine to DirettaRenderer for accurate playback configuration

**Technical Implementation:**
- `TrackInfo::DSDSourceFormat` enum to track DSF vs DFF files
- File extension parsing in AudioEngine to detect format type
- Fallback to codec string parsing if file detection fails
- Integration with DirettaOutput for correct bit order processing

### 🔧 Seeking Improvements

**DSD Raw Seek Enhancement**
- **File repositioning for DSD**: Precise seeking in raw DSD streams using byte-level positioning
- **Accurate calculation**: Bit-accurate positioning based on sample rate and channel count
- **Better logging**: Enhanced debug output showing target bytes, bits, and format information

**Benefits:**
- More accurate seek operations in DSD files
- Proper file pointer management during playback
- Improved user experience when scrubbing through DSD tracks

- `--thread-mode <value>`: Advanced Diretta SDK threading
- Network options: `--interface`, `--bind-ip` for multi-homed systems

### 📝 Configuration

**Default Settings (optimal for most users):**
```bash
Buffer: 2.0 seconds
Gapless: Enabled
Network: Auto-adaptive by format
```

**Low Latency Setup:**
```bash
./DirettaRendererUPnP --target 1 --buffer 0.5
# ~1.5s total latency with gapless still working perfectly
```

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed race condition in `prepareNextTrackForGapless()`
- Fixed potential deadlock during format changes
- Fixed double close() causing crashes
- Fixed pink noise on format changes due to improper buffer handling
- Fixed memory leak in error paths (proper cleanup with `.reset()`)

### 🔍 Debugging

sudo ./DirettaRendererUPnP --target 1 --verbose
# Shows detailed gapless, network, and buffer operations
```

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated installation guide
- Added gapless troubleshooting section
- Network optimization explained
- Buffer sizing recommendations

### ⚙️ Compatibility

- **Backward Compatible:** All v1.1.x features preserved
- **Control Points Tested:**
  - ✅ Roon (excellent gapless support)
  - ✅ BubbleUPnP (good support)
  - ✅ mConnect (basic support)
  - ⚠️ JPlay iOS (limited - no SetNextURI support)

### 🎯 Known Limitations

- Format changes require DAC resynchronization (~50-200ms gap) - hardware limitation
- Control points must support `SetNextAVTransportURI` for gapless
- Some control points (JPlay iOS) have limited gapless capabilities

### 🔄 Migration from v1.1.1

**No configuration changes needed!** Simply update binaries.

**Recommendations:**
1. Test with `--buffer 1.0` for lower latency (gapless still works)
